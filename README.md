# Hello!
This README is just here to say:  
This program is lightweight for one reason:  
**I coded it on a calculator!**  
See the [wiki](github.com/sawsaw99-stack/PyNN/wiki) for more...

# Note:  
If you haven't already noticed, this repo is kind of messy ðŸ˜†, but due to many factors, I am unable to.
Not that anybody is going to stumble upon this any time soon...
